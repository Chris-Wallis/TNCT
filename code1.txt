Now, interim President Bernie Sanders oversees a chaotic 2026 election dominated by new, progressive figures. Conservative hopes rest on Holly Brennan, who threatens a second southern secession. The US political future is uncertain, with a decisive electoral college win appearing unlikely. Daniel Rogers is the favourite, running for the Progressive Party, whilst is main opposition is moderate independent Oliver Mees. Third party candidates Chris Wallis (Liberal Socialists) and Randan Cerantola (Greens) look to deadlock the electoral college.<p>",

He lived a regular life until 1990 when he ran for Nevada’s 25th district, winning and holding that seat until 1994. Following his loss in 1994 to Brian Sandoval, he  returned to his previous law practice. Becoming a very well known political and law figure in Nevada over the next few years, he was appointed the Attorney General of Nevada in 2007, and his terms lasted until 2015. Following the end of his two terms, he ran for Governor of Nevada in 2018, winning the election narrowly. He was a relatively popular governor, but was swept up in the 2022 elections, and failed to win re-election. After his loss, he became a popular demagogue for the democratic party, and would be a good conciliatory VP choice.\n<p>",

He has served the Florida State House of Representatives since 2022 for the 103rd district. Whilst not well known nationally, his stances are well received in his constituency and the wider south, seen mostly as a moderate with some progressive policies. Now a Vice-Presidential option for many of those running in 2026, he would bring a southern voice to a heavily northern race, possibly swinging some states to whomever picks him.\n<p>",

He has little political experience, only serving as a campaign manager for Donald Trump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2004. He endorsed nobody for president in 2024, so has no unfortunate ties to unpopular politicians. He’s not exceptionally popular, but could provide a lot of money and establishment support to anyone who runs with him.

In 1994 he decided not to seek re-election, and retired to run for Governor. He successfully gained the nomination and won as the Democratic Party candidate in 1994. He was re-elected in 1998, but was term-limited after that. He stayed away after 2002, until 2006 when he ran, and won the Senatorial election. He’s popular in the northeast and decently well-known nationally. Having served as a governor, lieutenant governor, and now senator for 20 years, he’s a very experienced pick, and would reconcile a large amount of those who previously voted Democrat.",
