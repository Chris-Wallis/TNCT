In response, conservatives and moderates have rallied around Brayden Waddell, who is running for the Forward USA Party On the left, Santhush Pathirana has taken over the Progressive Party, and has chosen Nevada's Charlie Aston for VP. Chris Wallis and the Lib Socs are running again, with Luka Roberts as VP. Whilst the Mees government is very popular, they have lost the support of tactically voting conservatives that they had in 2026.",

His passionate support for the president netted him the position of Director of National Intelligence. He served the administration until their defeat in the 2020 election. Following Trump's defeat, he decried the poor sportsmanship and attempts to overturn the election. His switch led to a more favourable light being shone on him. Under the Biden administration, he ran for governor of Ohio, but lost the primaries in 2022. After the Trump return in 2024, he refused to cooperate and became an opponent in tune with Mitt Romney, someone whom he became a close ally of (Their policies are very similar).

He worked in engineering and manufacturing for 20 years until the age of 40, when he ran for Newark Mayor, and lost to Cory Booker. Following this embarrassing defeat, he stepped away from politics for a few years before a return in 2010 when he ran for New Jersey State Congressman for the 2nd district. He served that position until 2017 when he resigned following his appointment as the United States Secretary for Labour. He served the Trump administration until 2021, when they lost Re-election. He declined any involvement with the Trump administration past 2024, and regained some political reputation due to that. He has been a minor vocal opponent of Donald Trump, but is a conservative politician who could make your ticket plausible to those in the Midwest.<p>\n",

Sean ran for governor of Wyoming and narrowly won his term. He ran his administration as a fiscally responsible and socially moderate politician, balancing the budget and providing plenty of essential services to those in need. He won re-election in 2006 and continued his term. Despite the GFC in 2008, he maintained high popularity due to efforts to combat the effects of the recession. He challenged the legality of term limits in 2010, gaining his right to run for a third term, and winning. After 16 years as the extremely popular governor, he left office and ran for senate in 2018, winning the seat and entering National Politics. He has diligently served for the interests of his state for the last eight years, and is widely popular, winning elections by significant margins. He has chaired a couple senate committees, and had a good friendship with Mitt Romney. Miller will give a big boost in Wyoming if selected.<p>\n",
