In the Senate, the Progressive Party’s policy has been passed with the help of the Liberal Socialists, who combine for a strong majority. In the House, the Greens are also needed for legislation, who have been surprisingly co-operative. However, relations between the Progressives and the Liberal Socialists have slowly waned, finally reaching a climax after they repeatedly blocked the introduction of a national basic income. This argument has not been solved, as both sides campaign heavily. Meanwhile, Oliver Mees is back for round 2, with the support of the American Unity party, aiming to capitalise on the tension on his left, and former Alabama Senator Holly Brennan is hoping to deadlock the college running on a strong conservative platform. It’s anybody’s election, however Rogers and Pathirana, especially Pathirana, may have too much popularity to overcome.",

Raised in the city, he also attended College there and eventually entered the working scene there as well. He entered politics in 1984 when he ran for Lieutenant governor, winning by a relatively comfortable margin. He was re-elected in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992. In 1994 he decided not to seek re-election, and retired to run for Governor. He successfully gained the nomination and won as the Democratic Party candidate in 1994. He was re-elected in 1998, but was term-limited after that. He stayed away after 2002, until 2006 when he ran, and won the Senatorial election. He’s popular in the northeast and decently well-known nationally. Having served as a governor, lieutenant governor, and now senator for 20 years, he’s a very experienced pick, and would reconcile a large amount of those who previously voted Democrat.",

He declined any involvement with the Trump administration past 2024, and regained some political reputation due to that.

He has lived his entire life in Wyoming, graduating from College in 1990, he entered the political scene in 2002 after a career in business and lobbying. Sean ran for governor of Wyoming and narrowly won his term. He ran his administration as a fiscally responsible and socially moderate politician, balancing the budget and providing plenty of essential services to those in need. He won re-election in 2006 and continued his term. Despite the GFC in 2008, he maintained high popularity due to efforts to combat the effects of the recession. He challenged the legality of term limits in 2010, gaining his right to run for a third term, and winning. After 16 years as the extremely popular governor, he left office and ran for senate in 2018, winning the seat and entering National Politics. He has diligently served for the interests of his state for the last eight years, and is widely popular, winning elections by significant margins. He has chaired a couple senate committees, and had a good friendship with Mitt Romney. Miller will give a big boost in Wyoming if selected.<p>\n",
